???+ question "Ex. 2.1"
	Suppose each of $K$-classes has associated target $t_k$, which is a vector of all zeros, except a one in the $k$-th position. Show that classifying to the largest of $\hat y$ amounts to choosing the closet target, $\min_k\|t_k-\hat y\|$, if the elements of $\hat y$ sum to one.

??? done "Soln. 2.1" 

	We need to prove:

	\begin{equation}
	\underset{k}{\operatorname{argmax}} \hat y_k = \underset{k}{\operatorname{argmin}} \|t_k-\hat y\|^2             
	\label{eq:2-1a}
	\end{equation}

	By definition of $t_k$, we have

	\begin{align}
		\|t_k-\hat y\|^2 
		&= (1-\hat y_k)^2 + \sum_{l \neq k }(0 - \hat y_l)^2\nonumber\\
		&= (1-\hat y_k)^2 + \sum_{l \neq k }\hat y_l^2\nonumber\\
		&= 1 - 2\hat y_k + \sum\hat y_l^2
		\label{eq:2-1b}
	\end{align}


	Given $\eqref{eq:2-1b}$, it's straightforward to see that $\eqref{eq:2-1a}$ indeed holds because only $-2\hat y_k$ depends on $k$.

??? note "Remark"
	The assumption $\sum_{k=1}^K\hat y_k=1$ is actually not required.
